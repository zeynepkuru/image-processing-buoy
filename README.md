# Image Processing Buoy Example 

## Masking the Yellow Ball and Creating a Bounding Box:
### In this task, you will identify a yellow ball in a given image. The task details are:
1. Create a mask using OpenCV or similar Python libraries to identify the yellow color in the given image.
2. Detect the contour of the yellow ball in the masked image.
3. Select the largest yellow ball, using the contour area for this selection.
4. After identifying the largest yellow ball, accept this object as the yellow ball.
5. Create a bounding box around the yellow ball. The bounding box represents the smallest rectangle that encloses the yellow ball.
6. Write a Python code that returns the coordinates of the largest yellow ball and the dimensions of its bounding box.
